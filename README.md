# 🔐 Basic Cipher Text Encryption

A simple Python script for encrypting and decrypting messages using a basic cipher algorithm. This project is great for understanding how text-based encryption works at a foundational level.

## ✨ Features

- Encrypts plaintext using a basic cipher method
- Decrypts ciphertext back to readable text
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Easy to modify and extend for other cipher techniques

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies)

## 📦 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-cipher.git
cd basic-cipher
python Ceases_Cipher.py

📚 Concepts Demonstrated
String manipulation

ASCII/Unicode character shifting

Functions and user input

Basic encryption logic

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add support for different cipher types (e.g., Vigenère, ROT13)

-  GUI version using Tkinter

- Save encrypted messages to file
